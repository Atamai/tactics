 3.) Installing
 4.) Contributing

== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * Boost C++ Libraries v1.37+ [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
  * Qt Framework v4.5+
  * UnitTest++ (a.k.a. unittest-cpp)
    * Note: UnitTest++ must be installed in /usr/local. An installation guide is available at: http://www.rioki.org/2012/06/05/howto-incall-unittestpp.html.

== 2. BUILDING ==

 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

== 3. INSTALLING ==

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".

== 4. CONTRIBUTING ==

 This project has been created with strict following of the Google C++ Style Guide, available at: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml. Please follow the coding style. In some cases (commonly when subclassing external files) the files may follow a different coding style as defined by the project. In such cases, follow the style of the file to maintain consistency.
